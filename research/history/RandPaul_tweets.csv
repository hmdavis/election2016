672808204812853249,2015-12-04 16:02:30,"I have a few thoughts on what true national security is, how we achieve it, and the abysmal record of one of my opponents in this area."
672808276673867776,2015-12-04 16:02:47,The first job of the President should be to secure our borders and fix broken refugee and visa systems to stop terrorists.
672808594505605120,2015-12-04 16:04:03,"This President has utterly failed at the job.  I have led, and proposed measures to fix the problems."
672808794779447296,2015-12-04 16:04:51,"But as I led, Marco Rubio has gone the other way, preferring open borders, broken systems and siding with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer"
672808939185119232,2015-12-04 16:05:25,"Yesterday I introduced my SECURE bill as an amendment in the Senate, to protect our borders and resources.  Marco Rubio voted no"
672809168043159552,2015-12-04 16:06:20,"During his Gang of 8 bill, I proposed the toughest border security/refugee-visa reform measures in my Trust but Verify Amendment."
672809327661604865,2015-12-04 16:06:58,"Marco Rubio voted against my border security and refugee/visa reform measures then too, leaving us less safe."
672809680293502977,2015-12-04 16:08:22,"And as far back as the FL legislature, Marco Rubio opposed toughening reporting requirements at Florida colleges for those on student visas"
672809871625072640,2015-12-04 16:09:08,"This is nothing new, it is a pattern through his entire career. I want to secure our borders, fix our broken systems. Marco Rubio opposes."
672810147228590080,2015-12-04 16:10:13,National security requires it. And it should be a test for the next President. Support real border security and halt to refugee/visas?

673683983117496320,2015-12-07 02:02:32,Let's be clear: disarming more law abiding citizens will not stop mass murderers and terrorists.
673684099194863616,2015-12-07 02:03:00,We should be advocating for more concealed carry ability for law abiding Americans and end to unconstitutional gun free zones.

674614006200438785,2015-12-09 15:38:07,Yesterday the Obama White House had the nerve to say someone else was unqualified for office.
674614046465781760,2015-12-09 15:38:17,"After 5 years of acting like a King and ignoring our constitution, that takes a lot of nerve."
674614092003278850,2015-12-09 15:38:27,Today I would like to put a mirror in front of the Obama White House and show them the top ten things that make HIM unqualified:
674614206562373632,2015-12-09 15:38:55,"1.  Tried to take over 1/6 of economy in Obamacare, wrecked the system and hurt patients and taxpayers"
674614231694598144,2015-12-09 15:39:01,2.  Thinks an executive order is legislation and how you make law
674614252703887360,2015-12-09 15:39:06,"3.  Fought an undeclared, unconstitutional war in Libya, turned it into Jihadist wonderland"
674614477736697857,2015-12-09 15:39:59,"4.  Fighting an undeclared, unconstitutional war in Syria, trying to put ISIS in Damascus."
674614534661783553,2015-12-09 15:40:13,5.  Signed into law the indefinite detention of American citizens
674614557470408705,2015-12-09 15:40:18,"6.  His copy of the bill of rights obviously goes from 1 to 3, skipping the 2nd amendment."
674614585106677760,2015-12-09 15:40:25,7.  Court ruled his NSA spying on every American was illegal.
674614606812196864,2015-12-09 15:40:30,8.  He has added more debt than anyone in history.
674614632103829504,2015-12-09 15:40:36,9.  Appointed an attorney general who thinks speech against Muslims is a bigger threat than terrorism.
674614671458959362,2015-12-09 15:40:46,10.  EPA rules by executive FIAT trying to kill an entire American industry and way of life (coal).
