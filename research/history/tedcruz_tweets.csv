674973053630058498,2015-12-10 15:24:51,What America needs is a firm resolve to always protect Americans’ freedom at home and moral clarity that starts with defining the enemy.
674973299139457026,2015-12-10 15:25:49,A safe America starts with a secure America. It is beyond time to secure our border.
674974233022234625,2015-12-10 15:29:32,There are some on the Right and Left who want to exploit our current crisis by calling on Americans to surrender constitutional liberties.

674976391377502208,2015-12-10 15:38:06,And it is preventing Americans from taking basic steps to protect themselves.
674976653420859392,2015-12-10 15:39:09,Our third goal must be to restore America’s leadership in the world.
674976863492562944,2015-12-10 15:39:59,"As Reagan knew well, the best way to project America’s leadership is by protecting and promoting America’s strength."
